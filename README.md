## Overview

we-make-software.com provides a platform for developers to collaborate on open-source projects in the C programming language. Whether you're new to programming or an experienced developer, this repository welcomes all contributions that align with our goal of promoting software development excellence.


## WMS Operating System Connection

"WMS Operating System Connection" is a UMDF2 (User-Mode Driver Framework version 2) project designed to interface with the operating system. 
The project is developed under the acronym "WMS," which stands for "We Make Software." 
This driver operates in user mode, providing enhanced system stability and security by isolating driver operations from the kernel mode.

## WMS System

"WMS System" is a Kernel-Mode Driver Framework (KMDF) project designed to provide efficient and reliable communication with the Windows Operating System. 
This driver operates in kernel mode, enabling it to perform high-performance and low-level operations.

### Features

- **Collaboration:** Engage with fellow developers on C-based open-source projects.
- **Learning:** Explore best practices and techniques in C programming.

**Share and Follow!**

If you don't understand a lesson, let us know, and we will try to make it more detailed. We don't know how deep We need to explain, but if anyone needs a deeper explanation, I will try to provide it. Users can reply or point you in the right direction. If the subject is not about UMDF2 or KMDF, it will be removed.

**How to Ask a Question:**
- Can you explain to me about "something"?
- I feel this is wrong. Maybe you can improve it with this.
- I don't understand it.

**Community Guidelines:**
- Speak nicely in this group.
- If you feel someone is speaking badly, contact an administrator or moderator.
- Everyone is equal.
- We respect everyone.
- If the answer is good, remember to give it a like so each user can grow in points.
